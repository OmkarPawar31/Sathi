# Sathi - Mental Health Companion üß†üíö

Building this for the hackathon - it's been quite a journey! Sathi (meaning "companion" in Hindi) is a mental health platform connecting patients with doctors.

## What I've Built So Far

- **Patient Dashboard**: Book appointments, view doctors, manage sessions
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Patient management, scheduling, medical records  
- **Appointment System**: Calendar booking, different consultation types
- **Authentication**: Role-based login (User vs Psychiatrist)

## Tech Stack
- React 19 (still getting used to the new features!)
- Vite for fast development
- Lucide React for icons
- Custom CSS (no framework, wanted to learn styling from scratch)

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then go to http://localhost:5173

## Demo Accounts

**For Patient View:**
- Sign up as "User"
- Use any email/password

**For Doctor View:**  
- Sign up as "Psychiatrist"
- Need to enter a license number (use any fake one like "MH12345")

## Current Status

‚úÖ Basic UI working  
‚úÖ Both dashboards functional  
‚úÖ Mock data integrated  
‚è≥ Need to add backend API  
‚è≥ Payment integration pending  
‚è≥ Real-time chat for consultations  

## Known Issues

- Some console warnings about React keys (will fix later)
- Mobile responsiveness needs work
- Need to replace alerts with proper notifications
- Search could be faster with debouncing

## Notes to Self

- The patient cards took forever to get right
- Calendar component was tricky - might refactor later
- CSS is getting messy, consider moving to styled-components
- Remember to remove console.logs before demo!
